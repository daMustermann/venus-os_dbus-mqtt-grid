# dbus-mqtt-grid - Emulates a physical Grid/Genset/AC Load Meter from MQTT data

<small>GitHub repository: [mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid)</small>

### Disclaimer

I wrote this script for myself. I'm not responsible, if you damage something using my script.





### Purpose

The script emulates a physical Grid/Genset/AC Load Meter in Venus OS. It gets the MQTT data from a subscribed topic and publishes the information on the dbus as the service `com.victronenergy.grid.mqtt_grid`, `com.victronenergy.genset.mqtt_genset` or `com.victronenergy.acload.mqtt_acload` with the VRM instance `31`.

It also supports the Tasmota-SmartMeter format.


### Config

Copy or rename the `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini` in the `dbus-mqtt-grid` folder and change it as you need it.

Alternatively you can use the json structure produced by Tasmota-EnergyMeter (see section [tasmota](#Tasmota))

#### Tasmota

Setting up tasmota as Tasmota-SmartMeter is not part of this documentation. See https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics
or https://homeitems.de/smartmeter-mit-tasmota-auslesen/# (German) for detailed information on how to set up Tasmota-EnergyMeter.

In order to get dbus-mqtt-grid working with the Tasmota-SmartMeter, the script on tasmota has to be configured in a specific way.

Depending on your individual Smart Meter, the first part of the script looks like this:
```
>D
>B
=>sensor53 r
>M 1
+1,3,s,0,9600,grid
```
Important for dbus-mqtt-grid is, that the `<jsonPrefix>` of the [meter definition](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-definition) is called `grid`.

Following is an example of the [meter metrics](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics):
```
1,77070100100700ff@1,Current Consumption,W,power,16
1,77070100240700ff@1,Current Consumption P1,W,power_L1,16
1,77070100380700ff@1,Current Consumption P2,W,power_L2,16
1,770701004c0700ff@1,Current Consumption P3,W,power_L3,16
```

Important are the 2 last parts of each line.
- The last number (`16`) lets tasmota transmit this reading via mqtt immediately. This is necessary to get updates of the current power consumption as fast as possible.
- The second last entry needs to be named exactly like this: L1: `power_L1`, L2: `power_L2`, L3: `power_L3`, total grid power: `power`. These are the keywords that are expected by dbus-mqtt-grid.

The MQTT messages sent from tasmota should then look like this:
```
21:57:13.103 RSL: SENSOR = {"Time":"2023-11-22T21:57:13","grid":{"power":413}}
21:57:13.124 RSL: SENSOR = {"Time":"2023-11-22T21:57:13","grid":{"power_L1":94}}
```

Sending the total energy (kWh consumed and delivered) is also possible.
Since those values are not changing much, it is sufficient to transmit them only every [TelePeriod](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#teleperiod) seconds.
<br>Again, the important parts are the last two of each line, where `3` in this case means that you will get a precision of 3 digits (see  [meter metrics/precision](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics)).
```
1,77070100010800ff@1000,Total Consumed,KWh,energy_forward,3
1,77070100020800ff@1000,Total Delivered,KWh,energy_reverse,3
```

It is possible to directly use the ip address of your venusOS installation as MQTT host in tasmota.
For this to work, set the MQTT part of `config.ini` to `localhost` and enable the MQTT server on your venusOS: https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-mqtt#set-up


The topic in tasmota has to fit together with the config.ini. For example:
```
Tasmota Topic: SML
Tasmota Full Topic: %topic%/
config.ini topic = SML/SENSOR
```

#### Home Assistant

See this [comment](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid/issues/10#issuecomment-1826763558).

### Install

1. Login to your Venus OS device via SSH. See [Venus OS:Root Access](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access#root_access) for more details.

2. Execute this commands to download and extract the files:

    ```bash
    # change to temp folder
    cd /tmp

    # download driver
    wget -O /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid.zip https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

    # If updating: cleanup old folder
    rm -rf /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid-master

    # unzip folder
    unzip venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid.zip

    # If updating: backup existing config file
    mv /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid_config.ini

    # If updating: cleanup existing driver
    rm -rf /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid

    # copy files
    cp -R /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid-master/dbus-mqtt-grid/ /data/etc/

    # If updating: restore existing config file
    mv /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid_config.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.ini
    ```

3. Copy the sample config file, if you are installing the driver for the first time and edit it to your needs.

    ```bash
    # copy default config file
    cp /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.sample.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.ini

    # edit the config file with nano
    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.ini
    ```

4. Run `bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/install.sh` to install the driver as service.

   The daemon-tools should start this service automatically within seconds.

### Uninstall

Run `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/uninstall.sh`

### Restart

Run `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/restart.sh`

### Debugging

The logs can be checked with `tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-grid/current | tai64nlocal`

The service status can be checked with svstat `svstat /service/dbus-mqtt-grid`

This will output somethink like `/service/dbus-mqtt-grid: up (pid 5845) 185 seconds`

If the seconds are under 5 then the service crashes and gets restarted all the time. If you do not see anything in the logs you can increase the log level in `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/dbus-mqtt-grid.py` by changing `level=logging.WARNING` to `level=logging.INFO` or `level=logging.DEBUG`

If the script stops with the message `dbus.exceptions.NameExistsException: Bus name already exists: com.victronenergy.grid.mqtt_grid"` it means that the service is still running or another service is using that bus name.

### Multiple instances

It's possible to have multiple instances, but it's not automated. Follow these steps to achieve this:

1. Save the new name to a variable `driverclone=dbus-mqtt-grid-2`

2. Copy current folder `cp -r /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/ /data/etc/$driverclone/`

3. Rename the main script `mv /data/etc/$driverclone/dbus-mqtt-grid.py /data/etc/$driverclone/$driverclone.py`

4. Fix the script references for service and log
    ```
    sed -i 's:dbus-mqtt-grid:'$driverclone':g' /data/etc/$driverclone/service/run
    sed -i 's:dbus-mqtt-grid:'$driverclone':g' /data/etc/$driverclone/service/log/run
    ```

5. Change the `device_name`, increase the `device_instance` and update the `topic` in the `config.ini`

Now you can install and run the cloned driver. Should you need another instance just increase the number in step 1 and repeat all steps.

### Compatibility

It was tested on Venus OS Large `v2.92` on the following devices:

* RaspberryPi 4b
* MultiPlus II (GX Version)
